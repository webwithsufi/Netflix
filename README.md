# Netflix Clone Project



This project is a simple clone of the Netflix landing page, built using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the basic layout and styling of the Netflix website's initial sign-up screen.



## Features



-   **Navbar:** Includes the Netflix logo and sign-in buttons.

-   **Hero Section:** Features the main Netflix tagline, a call to action to join, and an email input with a "Get Started" button.

-   **Separation Lines:** Clear visual dividers between sections.

-   **Feature Sections:** Replicates the layout for showcasing key Netflix features like:

    -   Enjoy on your TV

    -   Download your shows to watch offline

    -   Watch everywhere

    -   Create profiles for kids

-   **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):** A basic implementation of the FAQ section with expandable (visually, not functionally in this basic clone) questions.

-   **Footer:** Includes links to various Netflix-related pages (Investor Relations, Jobs, Help Centre, etc.) and a language selection dropdown.

-   **Basic Styling:** Uses CSS to mimic the colors, fonts, and overall look of the Netflix landing page.



## Technologies Used



-   HTML5

-   CSS3



## Project Structure

 -   `index.html`: Contains the main HTML structure of the Netflix clone.

-   `style.css`: Contains all the CSS styles for the project.

-   `assets/images/`: Directory containing images used in the project (like the Netflix logo).

-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.



## How to Run Locally



1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash

    git clone [repository URL]

    ```

    *(Replace `[repository URL]` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)*



2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash

    cd netflix-clone

    ```



3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser:** Simply double-click the `index.html` file or right-click and choose "Open with" followed by your preferred browser.



## Code Highlights



-   **Semantic HTML:** Uses appropriate HTML5 semantic tags like `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` for better structure and readability.

-   **Flexbox and Grid:** Likely utilizes Flexbox and/or CSS Grid for layout management, especially for the feature sections and footer.

-   **CSS Styling:** Employs CSS to match the visual design of the Netflix landing page, including colors, typography, and spacing.



## Future Improvements



-   **Functional FAQ:** Implement JavaScript to make the FAQ questions expandable/collapsible.

-   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the layout adapts well to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile devices) using media queries.

-   **Language Selection Functionality:** Add actual functionality to the language dropdown in the navigation.

-   **More Accurate Styling:** Refine the CSS to achieve a pixel-perfect resemblance to the real Netflix page.

-   **Potential JavaScript Animations/Interactions:** Add subtle animations or interactions for a more engaging user experience.
